Later in the experiment you will have to make a decision between the following two options:
<br>
    <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Option A</b>: keep the &pound5 for yourself and the charity "Save the Children" gets &pound0.</li>
                <li><b>Option B</b>: keep &pound1 and the charity "Save the Children" gets &pound8. </li>
            </ul>
<br>

In addition, you will have to see a video. Below, we provide you with a description of the video that you will see:
<br>
    <br>
       <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
          <p>  "The video is part of a campaign by "Save the Children" showing the struggles of a nine-year-old girl when her city becomes a warzone. As the political conflict escalates, the girl and her family experience increasingly traumatic hardships and perils. ‚Äù</p>
</div>
<br>
How can you choose between Option A and Option B? There are three possibilities:


  <div id= "grid" class="grid-container center" >
      {{ for choice in C.CHOICES }}
  <div data-id="{{ choice }}"  class="grid-item handle highlight card">{{ choice }}</div>
      {{ endfor }}
      </div>
    <br>
You choose one of these three and your choice will be implemented with a 60% probability. You should choose what is your preferred option  ecause this will be implemented most of the time.

    </div>
    </div>




<p>
<div style="text-align:center" >{% next_button %}</div>

</p>
<script>
var ul = document.getElementById('grid');
for (var i = ul.children.length; i >= 0; i--) {
    ul.appendChild(ul.children[Math.random() * i | 0]);
}</script>
