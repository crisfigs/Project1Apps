As we explain in the previous page, alternatives that are upper in the ranking are more likely to be implemented.
This also means that alternatives fruther down in teh ranking are less likely to be implemented. For this reason, it is in your best inters
to provide your true ranking i.e., your true preferences. In the case that you receive your ranking,the first
alternative (top 1st) has a 50% chance of realizing, the second ranked has a 30% and the wrd ranked alternatives
has a 20% chance of being implemented. Of course, remeber that you only receive your ranking sometimes as theere is a
very small chance that your ranking is overriden and that you end up receiveng the alternative where you watch the video
and decide between the options later.
